# Github Pull Request File Header

When viewing changes on a Github pull request, this will add a page header showing
you the current filename.  That way when you've scrolled down from the file header
and can't remember which file you're looking at, you don't have to scroll back to
look at the file header.  You can keep your place!

When you're reviewing a big file and you've scrolled down a bit, sometimes you lose track of what file you're looking at...

But you can have a header to show you!
